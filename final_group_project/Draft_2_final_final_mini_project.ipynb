    "Figure 1: Diagram describing the pathway involving TNF-α physiological's response.\n",
    "* TNF-α is an inflammatory molecule (termed as cytokines), where it is secreted by cells under stress.\n",
    "* It initiates inflammation by triggering a cascade of other inflammatory molecules which recruit immune cells to further drive\n",
    "inflammation.\n",
    "* TNF-α levels will decrease rapidly after elimination of pathogens or undesired junk, causing cessation of inflammation.\n",

    "Figure 2: Schematic describing TNF-α synthesis, processing and export pathway.\n",
    "* Here, an inflammatory stimuli is input from the surroundings.\n",
    "* This will activate a transduction pathway, upregulating the expression of TNF-α in the cell. The TNF-α gene will be transcribed into mRNA, it will be translated in the cytoplasm by the ribosomes, forming a pre-protein (meaning immature protein).\n",
    "* The pre-TNF-α, will be transported into the endoplasmic reticulum for processing, and subsequently be transported into Golgi apparatus based for further transporting, packing and finally, transport out of the cell.\n",
    "* This transport is facilitated by Kinesin-1, which carries the package on the microtubules, out of the cell\n",

    "* Patients with hyperinflammatory diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Crohn's Disease, Psoriasis, where they exhibit excessive release of cytokines during inflammation, known as cytokine storm\n",
    "* Following the excessive release of cytokines during inflammation, it causes hyperactivation of the immune system and (dangerously) high levels of inflammation. As it will also cause a release in TNF-α, it generates a positive feedback loop and further manifests the hyperinflammatory response.\n",
    "* This damages healthy cells and tissues, increasing the risk of developing autoimmune diseases and organ damage (as such in Crohn's Disease)\n",

    "* Common treatments utilise neutralising antibodies that target TNF-α, blocking its interaction with TNF-α receptors on cell surfaces and this in turn, blocks the activation of TNF-α pathway described in Figure 1.\n",
    "* However, they are not always effective as:\n",
    "    * While they are effective at blocking the action of soluble TNF-α, it might be less effective at blocking membrane-bound TNF-α\n",

    "* A plasmid with constitutive promoters are designed, containing conding sequences for:\n",
    "    * TNF-α, tagged to streptavidin binding protein (SBP) and Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP)\n",
    "    * KDEL-streptavidin\n",
    "        * KDEL refers to the alphabetical representative of the amino acids it code for: Lysine, Aspartic Acid, Glutamic Acid and Leucine respectively.\n",
    "        * These specific amino acid sequences serve as an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, where proteins tagged with these are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. In our case, streptavidin is tagged with KDEL sequence and will be immobilised in the endoplasmic reticulum, which will come in handy later.\n",
    "* The recombinant plasmid is then packaged into a lentivirus, where it is further added to our HeLa cells for transfection. Lentiviruses are retroviruses which has robust capacity to infect a wide variety of mammalian cells, and release their genetic material into the host cell for virus propagation.\n",
    "* In our case, the transfection allows for the introduction of our recombinant plasmid into our cells in the study, where the sequences on the plasmid will get expressed due to the involvement of a constitutive promoter.\n",
    "* As the TNF-α-SBP-GFP and KDEL-streptavidin gets transcribed and translated, KDEL-streptavidin will get immobilised in the endoplasmic reticulum, where due to the affinity of streptavidin and SBP from the TNF-α-SBP-GFP protein, they will interact and cause the trapping of TNF-α-SBP-GFP in the endoplasmic reticulum. This prevents future processing and trafficking of the TNF-α-SBP-GFP protein.\n",
    "* Biotin is a protein where it readily enters the cell through transporters. They possess high affinity for streptavidin due to its complementary shape and possessing extraordinarily high dissociation constant, making their interaction one of the strongest amongst the group of non-covalent interactions.\n",
    "* As such, as biotin is added into the cell culture media, it enters the cell and endoplasmic reticulum and binds to streptavidin. This interaction displaces the interaction and dissociates streptavidin from TNF-α-SBP-GFP, releasing TNF-α-SBP-GFP.\n",
    "* TNF-α-SBP-GFP will then be further transported to the Golgi apparatus for processing, packaging and sorting, where it will ultimately be transported out for secretion through Kinesin-1 and the web-like microtububle scaffold.\n",
    "* As mentioned in Section 1.5, kinesore inhibits the mechanism of Kinesin-1, blocking the cellular railway road that transports proteins out from the Golgi apparatus to the exterior of the cell.\n",
    "* In our case, we wanted to investigate whether:\n",
    "    1. The cells are responsive to the drug\n",
    "    2. To what extent\n",
